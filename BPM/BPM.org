** Caso da BuildIT
   When *BuildIT site engineers need to rent a piece of equipment*
   they *fill in a form* called  "Equipment Rental Request" 
   and 
   *send this request by email* to one of the clerks at the company's depot

   The *clerk at the depot receives the request*
   and, *after consulting the catalogs of the equipment suppliers*, 
   *selects the most cost-effective equipment that complies with the request*.

   Next, the *clerk checks theavailability of the selected equipment*
   with the supplier via phone or email

   _Sometimes the selected option is not available_. 
   In these cases, _the clerk has to select an alternative piece
   ofequipment_ 
   and *check its availabilitywith the corresponding supplier*.


   After  finding  a  suitable  and  available  piece  of  equipment,  
   *the  clerk  adds  the  details  ofthe selected equipment to the
   rental request*. 
   *Each rental request has to be approved by aworks  engineer*,  who
   also works  at  the depot. 

   _In some cases_,  _the works  engineer  rejectsthe equipment rental
request_. 
   *Some rejections lead to the cancelation of the request*, i.e., noequipment is rented at all.


   *Other rejections are resolved by replacing the selected
equipmentwith another equipment-such as a cheaper piece of equipment
or a more appropriate pieceof equipment for the job*. 
In this latter case, the *clerk needs to lodge another availabilityrequest*.


   *When  a  works  engineer  approves  a rental  request*,  
   *the clerk  sends  a  confirmation  to thesupplier*. 
   This confirmation includes a Purchase Order (PO) for renting the
   *equipment. 
   ThePO is produced by BuildIT's financial information system using
   *information entered by the clerk. 
   
   *The clerk also records the equipment rental in a spreadsheet* that is used to monitorall ongoing equipment rentals.

   *In the meantime, the site engineer may decide that the equipment is no longer needed*. 
   *In this case, the engineer asks the clerk to cancel the request for renting the equipment*.

   *In due time, the supplier  delivers  the rented equipment  to the
construction  site*. 
   *The site engineer then inspects the equipment*. 
   /If everything is in order/, *the site engineer accepts the
engagement* and the *equipment is put into use*. 
   /In some cases/, *the equipment is sent backbecause it does not
comply with the requirements* of the site engineer. 
  
   /In this case, the site engineer has to start the rental process all over again/.


   /When the rental period expires/, 
   *the supplier comes to pick up the equipment*. 
   
   /Sometimes,the site engineer asks for an extension of the rental
period/ *by contacting the supplier viaemail or phone 1 to 2 days
before pick-up*. 

   *The supplier may accept or reject this request*. 

   /A few days after the equipment is picked up/, 
   *the equipment's supplier sends an invoice to theclerk by email*. 
   
   /At this point/, *the clerk asks the site engineer to confirm that the equipment was indeed rented for the period indicated in the invoice*. 

   *The clerk also checks if the rental prices indicated in the
invoice are in accordance with those in the PO*. 

   /After these checks/, *the clerk forwards the invoice to the
financial department*. 

   *The financial department eventually pays the invoice*
   
   

** Ingredientes de um Processo de Negócio
***   Eventos,Tarefas,Pontos de Decisões, Atores,Organizações,Sistemas de Software
**** Evento
     Events correspond to things thathappen atomically, which means that
     they have no duration p.3
     The arrival of a piece equipment at a construction site is an event
     This event may trigger the executionof a series of
     activities. P.4 
     For example, when a piece of equipment arrives, the siteengineer inspects it.
     This inspection is an activity, in the sense that it takes time
**** Atividade     
     When an activity is rather simple and can be seen as one single
     unit of work,P.4
**** Pontos de Decisões     
     In addition to events and activities, a typical process
     includesdecision points, P.4
     For example, as a result of the inspection, the site engineer may
     decidethat the equipment should be returned or that the equipment
     should be accepted
**** Atores         
     Atores podem ser Humanos
     Sistemas de softwares atuando como se fossem humanos P4
     O Ator envolvido no processo que consome o produto do processo é
     chamado de cliente. P5 No caso do do aluguel de equipamento da
     BuildIT é o engenheiro de obra. P5
     
**** Organizações
     Um sistema de software pode atuar como se fosse uma organização P4
**** Objetos Físicos     
     Equipamentos, materiais, incluse documentos que podem ser de
     papel ou eletrônicos ou simplesmente um registro eletrônicao por exemplo P.4
     

     
     In this example, the customer is anemployee of  the organization
     (internalcustomer). In  other processes, such  as anorder-to-cash
     process, the customer is external to the organizationP6

     With respect to the above process, consider the following
     questions:1.  Who are the actors in this process?2.  Which actors
     can be considered as customers in this process?3.  What value
     does the process deliver to its customers?  What are the
     possible outcomes of this process? P6

     In light of the above, we define a business process asa collection of
     inter-relatedevents, activities, and decision points that involve a
     number of actors and objects,which  collectively lead  to  an
     outcomethat is  of  value to  at  least  one customer.P6
     
     Armed with this definition of a business process, we define BPM
     asa body ofmethods, techniques, and tools to identify, discover,
     analyze, redesign, execute, andmonitor business processes in
     order to optimize their performance. P6
